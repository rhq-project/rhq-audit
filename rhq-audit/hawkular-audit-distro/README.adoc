Build this and run standalone.sh to get an audit server running.

You send audit messages over the bus that are then stored. You can send audit messages via curl over the bus' REST interface:

curl -d "body={"subsystem":{"name":"mysub"},"message":"mymsg2","details":{"key2":"value2","key1":"value1"}}" http://localhost:8080/hawkular-bus/message/QueueName?type=queue
